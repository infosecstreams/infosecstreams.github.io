# InfoSec Streams FAQ

## What is InfoSec Streams?

InfoSec Streams is an actively community-maintained list of Information Security-related Twitch streams. The list is hosted on GitHub pages and includes a wide range of streamers who contribute content around cybersecurity topics.

## How is the list sorted?

The list is sorted based on 30-day activity, which helps users find active streams more easily.

## What happens to inactive streamers?

Streamers that haven't streamed in the last month are moved to the inactive streamers page. This ensures that the main list remains up-to-date with active content creators.

## Can I access the list of inactive streamers?

Yes, there is a separate page for streamers who have been inactive for the last month. You can access this list from the main GitHub page.

## Is the list of streamers exhaustive?

While the list includes a wide range of streamers, it is by no means exhaustive. The cybersecurity field is dynamic and new content creators are always emerging. The InfoSec Streams list aims to be as comprehensive as possible and relies on contributions from the community to stay up-to-date.
