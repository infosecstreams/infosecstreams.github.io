    `git checkout -b <your-branch>`

1. Update streamers.csv with your additions and/or deletions.

1. Commit and push:

    `git add streamers.csv; git commit -m'My Change Description'; git push -u origin <your-branch-name>`

1. [Create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) using the Github UI.

Nota Bene: PRs with merge conflicts or that are out of date with main may not be merged/accepted (depending on how lazy we feel or how hard it is to fix üòù)
