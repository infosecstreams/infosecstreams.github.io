# Infosec Streams List

## Contributing / Updating

TL;DR: To add or remove a streamer to the list please update `streamers.csv`.

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo in the Github UI or checkout the repo locally.

1. Ensure you are update to date with the `main` branch and then create a branch for your edits:

    `git checkout -b <your-branch>`

1. Update streamers.csv with your additions and/or deletions.

1. Commit and push:

    `git add streamers.csv; git commit -m'My Change Description'; git push -u origin <your-branch-name>`

1. [Create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) using the Github UI.

Nota Bene: PRs with merge conflicts or that are out of date with main may not be merged/accepted (depending on how lazy we feel or how hard it is to fix 😝)
